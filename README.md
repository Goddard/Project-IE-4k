## Current Status
Currently we have BG1 assets extracted and upscaled to 2k.  4k coming soon.  GemRB is the current target and it is working perfectly with a few simple changes to allow the interface to scale.

## Roadmap to Version 1
    Upscale assets
      - Focus on Interface MOS/BAM
    Mass Convert - Near Infinity
      - MOS 98% - This is working, but has small interface related bugs.
      - BAM 50% - This needs to have a "transference" function added along with Mass Convert feature.
      - TIS 0% - To be determined.
    Modify - GemRB
      - 70% - Add Setting Option "UpscaleFactor"
      - 80% - Modify Interface Files to use UpscaleFactor or Alternative
      - 80% - Modify Interface Related Importers to add UpscaleFactor or Alternative
      - 0% - Add Zoom In/Out

### Work Speed
One of the reasons this has been a little slower than I would like is we don't have enough tools to help with fast conversions of many assets at once.  Work is being done to NearInfinity to allow mass conversion.

### Near Infinity Branch
I haven't submitted my changes to the mainline project, but we can work off my branch to get the changes submitted and use them quickly between ourselves.  Here is the repo link - https://github.com/Goddard/NearInfinity
