# Project-IE-4k

## Description
The purpose of this project is to have native 2k/4k playable IE game assets and an engine capable of playing at those resolutions.  

## Current Status
Currently we have BG1 assets extracted and upscaled to 2k.  4k coming soon.  GemRB is the current target and it is working perfectly with a few simple changes to allow the interface to scale.

### Work Speed
One of the reasons this has been a little slower than I would like is we don't have enough tools to help with fast conversions of many assets at once.  Work is being done to NearInfinity to allow mass conversion.

### Near Infinity Branch
I haven't submitted my changes to the mainline project, but we can work off my branch to get the changes submitted and use them quickly between ourselves.  Here is the repo link - https://github.com/Goddard/NearInfinity
